Pandemics prevention with big-data and data-science
This application uses advanced location data collection to promote pandemic control, we have identified places that infected people have previously visited to alert you about the necessary measures for each type of virus, along with the WHO recommendation for preventing it.

Data are shared with government agencies that use them to develop containment strategies aimed at improving population well-being

We use native device technologies and data science to create popular disease and pandemic containment instructions, along with diagnostic options, first aid support and reliable sources of information.

The system is being developed to control all pandemics with control recommendations issued by WHO.

This project is being designed to participate in the Twillio Healthcare hackathon and its license will become MIT after the event.
